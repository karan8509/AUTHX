AUTHX - Secure Authentication System

The AUTHX system is a robust and scalable authentication platform designed to ensure secure user management. It incorporates multiple modern technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to deliver a seamless and secure experience for both users and administrators. Below are the key features and technical details:

Key Features:
User Signup:

Users can create accounts securely with email and password.

Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, ensuring sensitive information is never stored in plain text.

Input validation is implemented using Joi, ensuring that all required fields (e.g., email format, password strength) meet predefined criteria.

User Login:

After successful signup, users can log in to the platform.

User credentials are verified, and if they match the records, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is generated and returned.

The JWT serves as the authentication token for subsequent requests, ensuring a stateless authentication model.

Token-based Authentication:

Implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure and stateless user authentication.

Tokens are issued after login and are used for validating requests in protected routes.

JWT is stored securely on the client side (e.g., in an HTTP-only cookie or localStorage).

User Logout:

Logout functionality is provided to destroy the session and invalidate the authentication token, ensuring that users can't make unauthorized requests after logout.

RESTful APIs:

Developed structured RESTful APIs to handle authentication and user management.

The APIs follow the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and are designed to be intuitive and easily extendable.

Input Validation:

Used Joi to validate the data for each request, ensuring all input is sanitized and meets required criteria.

Prevents issues like SQL injection and ensures the integrity of incoming data.

Structured Error Handling:

Custom error handling mechanism is implemented to catch and handle errors in a consistent manner.

Responses are returned with appropriate status codes and informative messages for easy debugging and troubleshooting.

Technologies Used:
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.

Express.js: Framework used for building RESTful APIs.

MongoDB: Database to store user data (securely hashed passwords).

bcrypt: Used for hashing passwords and comparing them during login.

JWT: Token-based authentication system to manage sessions.

Joi: Input validation library for data integrity.

Middleware: Used for error handling, authentication, and request validation.

Security Considerations:
Password Hashing: Using bcrypt ensures that even if the database is compromised, user passwords cannot be easily deciphered.

JWT Authentication: Stateless tokens improve security by reducing the need for server-side sessions and preventing session hijacking.

HTTPS: For secure communication between the client and server (important when deploying to production).

Usage:
Signup: POST /api/auth/signup

Login: POST /api/auth/login

Protected Routes (Require JWT Token): GET /api/user/profile
